# @summary Manage configuration and services for a NFS client
#
# If using the ``nfs::client::mount`` define, this will be automatically called
# for you.
#
# @param blkmap
#   Whether to enable the ``nfs-blkmap.service`` which is required for pNFS.
#
#   * Required for parallel NFS (pNFS).
#   * Only applicable for NFSv4.1 or later
#
# @param callback_port
#   The port used by the server to recall delegation of responsibilities to a
#   NFSv4 client.
#
#   * Only applicable in NFSv4.0.  Beginning with NFSv4.1, a separate callback
#     side channel is not required.
#
# @param stunnel
#   Enable ``stunnel`` connections from this client to each NFS server
#
#   * Stunnel can only be used for NFSv4 connections.
#   * Can be explicitly configured for each mount in ``nfs::client::mount``.
#
# @param stunnel_socket_options
#   Additional stunnel socket options to be applied to each stunnel
#   connection to an NFS server
#
#   * Can be explicitly configured for each mount in ``nfs::client::mount``.
#
# @param stunnel_verify
#   The level at which to verify TLS connections
#
#   * Levels:
#
#       * level 0 - Request and ignore peer certificate.
#       * level 1 - Verify peer certificate if present.
#       * level 2 - Verify peer certificate.
#       * level 3 - Verify peer with locally installed certificate.
#       * level 4 - Ignore CA chain and only verify peer certificate.
#
#   * Can be explicitly configured for each mount in ``nfs::client::mount``.
#
# @param stunnel_wantedby
#   The ``systemd`` targets that need ``stunnel`` to be active prior to being
#   activated
#
#   * Can be explicitly configured for each mount in ``nfs::client::mount``.
